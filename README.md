# HR-Analytics-Job-Change-Prediction
This project is based on the Kaggle's dataset 'HR Analytics: Job Change od Data Scientists' (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists).
'aug_train', 'aug_test' and 'test_target' are the raw files given for the challenge.


In this repository you can find a .pbix file with all the code written in Python.
There are two .pptx files where I explain the problem and how I tried to solve it. It's written in Spanish (soon I'll be uploading the English version).
Also, you'll find a .pbix file where I made the dashboard that I used as as first approach to solving the challenge.
