# HR-Analytics-Job-Change-Prediction
This project is based on the Kaggle's dataset 'HR Analytics: Job Change od Data Scientists' (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists).
The 'data' folder contains the raw files given for the challenge: 'aug_train.csv', 'aug_test.csv'. The target values for the test dataframe were stored in 'jobchange_test_target_values.npy' served through a different URL (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/job-change-dataset-answer). I created the 'test_target.csv' file to analyze the whole test set with PowerBI.


In this repository you can find a .pbix file with all the code written in Python.
There are two .pdf files where I explain the problem and how I tried to solve it. It's written in Spanish (soon I'll be uploading the English version).
Also, you'll find a .pbix file where I made the dashboard that I made as as first approach to solving the challenge.
